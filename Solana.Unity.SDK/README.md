Solana.Unity-SDK is the interface to access [Solana.Unity-Core](https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-Core), Solnet implementation in .NET Standard 2.0 (Unity compatible).
The SDK support an In-game wallet with Web3auth authentication, phantom and SMS (upcoming). A set of convenience methods allows Unity developers to access all the methods implemented in Solana.Unity-Core, inluding MPL, native dex transations and more...

Solana.Unity-SDK started as a fork of [unity-solana-wallet](https://github.com/allartprotocol/unity-solana-wallet), but it has been detached due to the several changes we have made and upcoming pipeline of integrations.

## üë∑ Step-by-step instructions
1. If you have an older version of Unity that doesn't have imported Newtonsoft.Json just import it.
2. Create a new scene.
3. Import WalletController prefab into your scene.
4. Set RPC Cluster (Mainnet/Testnet/Devnet/Custom uri) on SimpleWallet script in WalletController prefab.
5. If you use custom URI be careful to use WS/WSS instead of HTTP/HTTPS because WebSocket does not work with HTTP / HTTPS.
6. Create new Canvas
7. Import WalletHolder prefab into the Canvas or if you want your design just import wallet prefab and customize the scene.
